# What is Taipy?

Taipy is an innovative **low-code** package to create complete applications in *Python*. It is composed of two independent components: a **Graphical User Interface** and a **Scenario Management** part.

</p>

The **Graphical User Interface** of Taipy allows anyone with basic knowledge of Python to create a beautiful and interactive interface. It is a simple and intuitive way to create a GUI. No need to know how to design web pages with CSS or HTML; Taipy uses an augmented syntax of Markdown to create your desired web page.

The **Scenario Management** component of Taipy is a powerful tool to manage business problems and pipelines. The implementation of **Taipy Core** is straightforward. For example, it will allow you to:
- Keep track of your KPI, data, scenarios, pipelines, etc.
- Have smart scheduling
- Simplify industrialization for DataViz, Machine-Learning, Optimization, etc.


You can use the GUI component without the Scenario Management and vice-versa. However, as you will see, they are incredibly efficient when combined.

This **'Getting Started'** will go through all the basic concepts of *Taipy* to create a complete application. Each step is based on the code of the previous one. At the end of it, you will be able to create a complete application using *Taipy*. So, without further delay, let's begin to code!
