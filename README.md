## What is Taipy Getting started

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our [website](https://www.taipy.io).

[Taipy Getting Started](https://docs.taipy.io/getting_started/) provides a step-by-step opening to Taipy. 
Taipy features are leveraged as the application becomes more and more complex.

A more in depth documentation of Taipy can be found [here](https://docs.taipy.io).

## Directory Structure

- `src`: Common code shared by all the steps. For more information, on each step a README.md file is available in their
  respective folder (`step_xx/ReadMe.md`).
- `prerequisite`: The presentation of Taipy prerequisites, in particular a Taipy installation documentation.
- `step_00`: The presentation of Taipy and the minimum code to run the gui.
- `step_01`: Presentation of the interactiveness of Taipy as well as different controls (slider and chart).
- `step_02`: Introduction to the on_change function with the choice of the week. The week displayed on the graph is 
  the week of the slider.
- `step_03`: Introduction to Taipy Core. Creation of the configuration for a baseline model.
- `step_04`: Add to the previous config, a pipeline config to create and execute the pipeline without the GUI.
- `step_05`: Add the execution of the pipeline thanks to a "Predict" button on the Gui (first button). The default 
  parameters are used to run the pipeline. The results are shown in a chart.
- `step_06`: Creation of a second pipeline (the machine learning pipeline : Auto-Regressive model). Creation and 
  execution of the scenario with the default parameters without the GUI.
- `step_07`: Scenario is being run at the beginning, and we can change the selected pipeline through a selector 
  (first selector) and a button.
- `step_08`: A first scenario is created. We can change the default parameters of this scenario with controls (date, 
  number, selector); the default parameters are the date, the number of predictions and max capacity. A 
  'change_scenario' button is pressed to apply these changes and re-submit the scenario.
- `step_09`: Now, we want to show how to create scenarios directly through the gui and keep track of them.
- `step_10`: Organize the page with a menu, layouts and parts that can be not rendered.
- `step_11`: Introduce the concepts of Cycles and primary scenarios. Deletion of a scenario and setting a scenario, 
  primary.
- `step_12`: Create a 'Performance' page that will compare all the primary scenarios and display metrics of these 
  scenarios.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Code of conduct for members and contributors of _taipy-getting-started_.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Instructions to contribute to _taipy-getting-started_.
- `index.md`: Landing page of the generated documentation. 
- `INSTALLATION.md`: Instructions to install _taipy-getting-started_.
- `LICENSE`: The Apache 2.0 License.
- `README.md`: Current file.
