# Getting Started with Taipy

Welcome to the **Getting Started** guide for Taipy. This tour shows you how to create an entire application using the two components of Taipy:

- **Graphical User Interface builder** (Taipy GUI): allows any Python developer to create a complex and interactive GUI.

 - **Scenario Management** (Taipy Core): implements a modern backend for any data-driven application based on your business case.

You can use Taipy GUI without Taipy Core and vice-versa. However, as you will see, they are incredibly efficient when combined.

Each step of the **'Getting Started'** will focus on basic concepts of *Taipy*. Note that every step is dependent on the code of the previous one. After completing the last step, you will have the skills to develop your own Taipy application. 

## Before we begin:

Three packages have to be installed:

 1. **Taipy** package;

 2. **scikit-learn**: A Machine-Learning package that will be used in the Getting Started user code;

 3. **statsmodels**: Another package for statitics used in the User Code of the Getting Started.

``` console
$ pip install taipy
$ pip install scikit-learn
$ pip install statsmodels
```

!!! info "This is the preferred method to install Taipy, as it will always install the most recent stable release."

    If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
    can guide you through the process.

It is recommended to use **Python scripts** (.py) to follow the Getting Started. If you want to use a **Notebook** (.ipynb), you need to take a look at the specific GUI functions for Notebooks. See the docs [here](https://docs.taipy.io/manuals/gui/notebooks/).

So, without further delay, let's begin to code!
