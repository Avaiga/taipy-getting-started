Taipy is composed of two different products: the Graphical User Interface and the Scenario Management. These two components are independant. You can use the GUI component without the Scenario Management and vice-versa. However, as you will see, they are extremely efficient when combined.

We will begin the 'Getting Started' with the Graphical User Interface where we will create our first web page. To create this first web client, we only need two lines of code. We create a Gui object with a String as a page in the parameter. Then, we run the Gui and the client link will be displayed. Enter the URL in your brownser or click on it to open your very first Taipy web client.

Note that we can put a style to the text. Taipy uses the Markdown syntax to style your text and more. Therefore, # creates a title, ## creates a subtitle. Put your text in $'*'$ to have in italics or in $'**'$ to have it in bold ($'*italics*'$, $'**bold**'$).
