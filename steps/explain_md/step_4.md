What we have done so far is describing our graph, this graph represents our process. We can create our first pipeline that we can run. We configure it; note that the 'task_configs' is a list so you don't have to worry about the order of the tasks. Taipy will do that for you and optimize its execution.

Then, we create our pipeline from its configuration, we submit it (execution) and we print the results of the "predictions" datanode.
