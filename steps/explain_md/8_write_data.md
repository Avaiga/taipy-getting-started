# How to xrite data and change your default parameters?

We have created your GUI to show a scenario. However, you had some input variables that you didn't change so far: the *number of predictions*, the *max capacity* and the *day*. It will be great if you could interact in real time with these parameters, change them and rerun your scenario. It is something that can easily be done with the 'write' function of datanodes. you are going to create control to change these values and you will run your scenario by clicking on a 'Change scenario' button.
