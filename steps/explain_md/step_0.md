Taipy is composed of two different concepts: the **Graphical User Interface** and the **Scenario Management**. These two components are independant. You can use the GUI component without the Scenario Management and vice-versa. However, as you will see, they are extremely efficient when combined.

With two lines of code, you will create your first Taipy web page. We create a Gui object with a String. Then, the client link will be displayed when you run the Gui. Enter or click the URL to open your very first Taipy web client.

Note that the text can be styled. Taipy uses the Markdown syntax to style your text and more. Therefore, # creates a title, ## creates a subtitle. Put your text in $'**'$ to have it in italics or in $'*'$ to have it in bold (**italics**, *bold*).
