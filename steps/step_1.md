After creating our first web client with just one line of text, we want to create a more complicated page. First, I have to introduce you the concept of 'controls'. A control is a Taipy graphical object that will be displayed on the client. A control can be a slider, a chart, a table, an input, a menu and so on. You can find the list here:?????.

 Every control has a similar syntax. It begins with '<|' and ends with with '|>'. Each parameter of a control is seperated by a pipe '|'. For example, you can find the parameters for a slider here: ????.

 Now that we know how to create a control, we can add them to our page. You can see in the code below how to display the value of a variable and a slider control. We also need a dataset to create our first chart.
