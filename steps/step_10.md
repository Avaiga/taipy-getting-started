In this step, we just want to change the layout of the page to have something more aesthetically pleasing. The 'layout' control creates invisible columns where you can put your texts and controls. Moreover, the 'part' control is used to render or not a particular part of the page. Here, the part will be displayed when the first scenario will be created. We add a menu on top of it that will render or not a part depending on the 'page' variable. This is how we can create easily multiple pages.
